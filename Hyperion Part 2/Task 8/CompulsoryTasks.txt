Bullet graph - These graphs are typically used to display performance data. 
			   They are used to compare one value, represented by a horizontal bar, 
			   to another value, represented by a vertical line, and relate those to qualitative ranges.


Box and whisker plot - A box and whisker plot is a way of summarizing a set of data measured on an interval scale. 
					   It is often used in explanatory data analysis. 
					   This type of graph is used to show the shape of the distribution, its central value, and its variability.


Density plot - A Density Plot visualises the distribution of data over a continuous interval or time period.
			   It is a representation of the distribution of a numeric variable.

COMPULSORY TASK 2:


Visualisation A:
- Make the font size smaller because it is currently too big for the graph
- Place the titles in the graph instead of outside so it looks neater and easier to read
- Display percentages to give a more accurate representation instead of having nothing.


Visualisation B:
- Put a title in the x-axis saying 'Days of the week' instead of leaving it blank
- Use different colors for each bar instead of using the same orange color for all of the bars
- 'Days of week' at the top is not an accurate title for what is being represented in the bar graph.
   Change it to something like 'Number of bags sold for each day of the week'


Visualisation C:
- The graph is too cluttered. There are too many variables in a single bar. Its hard to read.
- The title of the bar graph should be centralised and not pushed to the side.
- 'Month' should be at the bottom on the x-axis.
- Each department could have had its own bar
