Normalisation - In order to achieve good database design, Normalisation is used to break down
				a relational schema into smaller relations.
				It reduces redundancies and removes anamolies which in turn brings the database
				to a consistent state.


When is a table in 1NF - * All of the key attributes are defined
						 * There are no repeating groups in the table
                         * All attributes are dependent on the primary key


When is a table in 2NF - * It should be in the First Normal Form
					     * It should not have Partial Dependency


When is a table in 3NF - * It should be in the Second Normal Form
						 * It should not have Transitive Dependency
