The first scenario is to visualize the different forms of crimes that are committed in specific cities
in a given country. You will be able to see the volume of these crimes based on geographical location
and you will be able to see how crimes are ranked in each city.


The second scenario will be a visualisation of a school classroom in which students' marks are analysed
based on their location, race, gender and parental involvement in their homework. 
You will be able to accurately see which students perform better than others based on these factors
and how these said factors influence them positively or negatively.
